# Functioning

The following is a ranking of the three weeks in terms of general functioning of each patient. A short textual description, given by the physician who followed up the patient and 
carried out weekly in-depth interviews, motivates these rankings. Sometimes, they were able to provide a score out of 5, which is also included. In that case, 5/5 indicates a 
great week, while 3/5 relates to the average functioning of the patient. 

## Patient 1

- Week 1: 1/5, worst week (pain and fatigue after Covid19 vaccination)
- Week 2: 3/5, better week (recovering after Covid19 vaccination)
- Week 3: 2/5, worse than average week (CFS symptom upsurge due to bad weather)

## Patient 2

- Week 1: average week
- Week 2: average week
- Week 3: worst week 

Week 3 was worse than week 1 and 2, but it was not possible to make a meaningful distinction between week 1 and 2. 

## Patient 3

- Week 1: best week 
- Week 2: worse than average week
- Week 3: worst week 

## Patient 4

- Week 1: difficult week (scores in the middle compared to the other two weeks)
- Week 2: best week, but did not sleep well (the patient stopped with their sleeping medication on their own initiative)
- Week 3: worst week (the patient said that this week was more difficult than usual)

## Patient 5

- Week 1: average week (varying symptom severity)
- Week 2: worst week (severe flare-up of symptoms after heavy physical labour performed on wednesday)
- Week 3: best week, but relatively similar to week 1

## Patient 6

- Week 1: 2/5, worse than average week (fatigued due to a short trip taken the previous weekend and stress because of visitors)
- Week 2: 3/5, better week (relaxation due to good contacts, yoga, creativity)
- Week 3: 2/5, worse than average week (a lot of stress after difficult consultations with doctors and practical calls)

## Patient 7

- Week 1: 2.5/5, worst week (bad start of the week, could barely get out of bed, then ended with some good days)
- Week 2: 3/5, average week (good start of the week, then felt fatigued in the middle of the week, but improved again towards the end)
- Week 3: 4.5/5, best week (very good week, barely experienced any inhibitions throughout)
